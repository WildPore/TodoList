A basic todo list app for the Odin Project. My main learning goals are to implement storing and restoring data with `localstorage` and to practice scoping a personal project.

- Implement adding and completing tasks: I can type my to-dos into a text field, click a button, and then the to-do is added below the form
- Rebuild styles with sass, integrated into webpack so that SCSS files are converted into CSS, etc, etc, all automatically
